# AI-powered-RAG-system

📖 Agentic RAG - AI-Powered Document Retrieval and Q&A System
📌 Overview
This project implements an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Groq Llama 3, and ChromaDB. It enables document-based Q&A by processing PDFs, extracting key information, and generating accurate answers.

The system also leverages HuggingFace embeddings and various AI APIs to enhance document search and response accuracy.

🔍 Key Features
🚀 Document Ingestion & Vector Search
Loads PDF documents and splits text into chunks for processing.

Converts document text into vector embeddings using HuggingFace Embeddings.

Stores and retrieves semantic document vectors with ChromaDB.

🤖 AI-Powered Q&A
Uses Groq Llama 3 (Gemma2-9b-It) to generate precise, context-aware responses.

Processes natural language queries and retrieves relevant document sections.

🛠 Future Enhancements
✅ Integrate OpenAI and Anthropic models for comparison.
✅ Expand to support multi-document retrieval and cross-document analysis.
✅ Enhance UI with better document visualization tools.
